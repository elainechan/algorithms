## Notes

### Divide and Conquer
- **Steps**:
	1. _Divide_ the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
	2. _Conquer_ the subproblems by solving them _recursively_. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
	3. _Combine_ the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.

### Dynamic Programming
- Similar to _Divide and Conquer_ with a typical focus on _optimization_
- _Memoize_: solves each subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem.
- **Steps**:
	1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
	2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
	3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-upf ashion.
	4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

### Greedy Algorithms
- always makes the choice that looks best at the moment
- it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution

## Implementations Tips
- `import collections` when working with data structures
- Stacks and queues - use `deque` or `list` (list is faster, deque more powerful)
- Union find - use `set`
- Fenwick tree, prefix sum - code manually
- Do learn to implement:
	- Pascal Triangle
	- Priority Queue/heap
