## Asymptotic Analysis
- A "fast" algorithm's worst-case running time grows slowly with input size.
- Suppress _constant factors_ and _lower-order terms_.

## Union-Find
- Reflexive: p is connected to q
- Symmetric: if p is connected to q, q is connected to p
- Transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r, p is connected to r
